<!--
    This fixture is used in tests for an itemset/repeat bug. Briefly, forms with
    the following conditions fail to load:

    - The form contains a repeat
    - The repeat contains at least two itemsets which:
        - Have a "static" (details and commentary inline below) reference to
          items in a secondary instance
        - Are presented as a combination of `input[list]` and `datalist`
          elements

    Much of the inline commentary below is intended to:

    - clarify implementation trivia, explaining the nature of this bug and its
      various contributing factors

    - consolidate the explanation into a single place, as the various
      contributing factors are spread across multiple files/modules, across
      multiple projects

                    At present, Enketo Transformer renders a `datalist` for:

                        At present, Enketo Core performs optimizations for
                        certain itemsets, where their `nodeset`:

                        - referneces a secondary instance
                        - has only numeric predicates, if it has predicates at
                          all

                        These itemsets are treated as "static from secondary
                        instance".

                        @see {@link https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core/blob/f37eed223140f7bee2700af2b1b7277ceee71fe8/src/js/itemset.js#L31}

                        Additional commentary will be added in this fix to
                        discuss the above heuristic and its implementation in
                        greater detail.

                        While not explicit in the above heuristic, the
                        optimizations herein are only applied for `itemset`
                        children of repeats.

                        This fixture is used to test a defect in one of those
                        optimizations, but both are described here together for
                        future context. Such "static from secondary instance"
                        `itemset`s are:

                        1. Conditionally moved from their containing repeat
                           instance to its corresponding "repeat info" (more
                           commentary on that will be added in this fix as
                           well).

                            @see {@link https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core/blob/f37eed223140f7bee2700af2b1b7277ceee71fe8/src/js/repeat.js#L579}

                            Subsequently, `itemset.js` presently references such
                            `itemset`s and their related HTML/DOM elements in as
                            "shared", with some mention of their presence in a
                            "repeat info" (but not much local explanation about
                            how they got to be there).

                        2. Conditionally cached when handling `itemset` updates,
                           when their view form control:

                            - **is** a child of a repeat instance—i.e. **is
                              not** reparented as a shared template for multiple
                              repeat instances

                            - **is not** presented as a set of radio
                              inputs–radio inputs are handled specially in a
                              variety of places across the codebase, to either
                              benefit from or avoid their native behavior of
                              grouping by `name` attribute/property
