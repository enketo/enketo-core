### Internet Explorer 11 Build

Internet Explorer 11 is not supported and not tested. You may still have some success with running Enketo Core-powered forms in IE11 by:

1. Importing the `_iefix.scss` files in the theme entry files. These are commented out in the default CSS builds for the 3 themes.
2. Including polyfills using a script tag with the `nomodule` attribute (which will prevent loading this file on modern browsers). See removed code in [/build/index.html](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core/commit/4486d93bdffd4e11135cbcfc91aa8dd76c571944) for an example using a polyfill service + additional polyfill file(s) that is tested occasionally.
3. Creating a special IE11 build (using Babel) that transpiles Enketo Core's modern syntax to old syntax and (optionally) includes [js/src/workarounds-ie11.js](./sjs/src/workarounds-ie11). See the `compile-ie11` build task in the Gruntfile for an example and packages removed in [this commit](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core/commit/4486d93bdffd4e11135cbcfc91aa8dd76c571944).
4. Use loading tricks to avoid loading the IE11 build in modern browsers and avoid executing the modern build in IE11. See removed code in [build/index.html](https://github.com/enketo/enketo-core/commit/4486d93bdffd4e11135cbcfc91aa8dd76c571944) for a possible approach.

Note that as we convert more and more code to modern syntax forms on IE11 will become progressively _slower_. We no longer accept PRs for IE11 issues, and this repo will start breaking in IE11 in the course of 2020.
